## üìä Project Overview

This project analyzes **8 years** of salary data from San Francisco‚Äôs public workforce, aiming to:
- Predict salaries using **regression models**
- Analyze **gender-based pay gaps**
- Explore **economic and departmental compensation patterns**
- Build **interactive visualizations** for trend discovery and analysis

### üîç Key Focus Areas
- üìà Salary prediction through regression modeling  
- ‚öñÔ∏è Gender pay disparity detection and analysis  
- üßÆ Data preprocessing, cleaning, and feature engineering  
- üìä Statistical and interactive visualizations using Plotly  
- üìâ Model evaluation and interpretation  

---

## üß† Technical Implementation

### üßπ Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
- Handled missing values via strategic imputation  
- Detected and removed outliers using **IQR** and **Z-score** methods  
- Standardized and normalized numerical data  
- Engineered features for **temporal trends** (year, experience level)  
- Transformed skewed data distributions  

---

### ü§ñ Machine Learning Pipeline
- Implemented multiple **regression algorithms** (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest)  
- Performed **hyperparameter tuning** and **cross-validation**  
- Conducted **gender classification** based on pay structure  
- Analyzed **feature importance** to interpret salary determinants  
- Validated models for accuracy and robustness  

**Model Results:**
| Metric | Score |
|--------|--------|
| R¬≤ Score | **0.85** (High explanatory power) |
| Mean Squared Error | **0.12** (Low prediction error) |
| Cross-validation Score | **0.82** |
| Key Features | JobTitle > Experience > Department |

## ‚öñÔ∏è Gender Pay Analysis

**Key Results:**
- **Gender Pay Gap:** ~8.3% average difference (favoring males)  
- **Classification Accuracy:** 72% (gender-based salary prediction)  
- **Top Predictors:** OvertimePay, Benefits, TotalPay  
- **p-value < 0.05:** Gender differences statistically significant  

**Insights:**
- Persistent gap in technology and management roles  
- Benefits and overtime amplify disparity  
- Policy implications highlight the need for standardization
